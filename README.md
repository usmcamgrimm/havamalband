### Website for the Swedish band **[HAVAMAL](https://havamalband.com)**

### This website is built using these resources and technologies:

- Next.JS
- Vercel
- Cloudinary
- Emotion

What started as a simple database project for the VetsWhoCode cohort is ever-evolving and is now in its 7th iteration. I started it, then scrapped it, started again, then wrote the entire project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I wasn't happy with the result and felt limited. I decided to re-write the project in Gatsby so I could work with React and incorporate some features from Gatsby. My goal was to learn different technologies while improving the speed and usability of the website.

While upgrading the project to Gatsby version 3, I chose to use NetlifyCMS instead of Sanity, dropped Tailwind, and added Emotion.

Now, in v7, I elected to switch from Gatsby to Next.JS, eliminated the headless CMS, opted to use Markdown for the news posts, and used CSS modules in place of the dependance on styled components on each page.
