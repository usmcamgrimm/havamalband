### Website for the Swedish band **[HAVAMAL](https://havamalband.com)**

### This website is built using these resources and technologies:

* GatsbyJS
* Netlify CMS
* Cloudinary
* Emotion

What started as a project for the VetsWhoCode cohort has evolved and is now in its 4th iteration. I started it, then scrapped it, started again, then wrote the entire project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I wasn't happy with the result and felt limited. I decided to re-write the project in Gatsby so I could work with React and incorporate some features from Gatsby.  My goal was to learn different technologies while improving the speed and usability of the website.

While upgrading the project to Gatsby version 3, I kept Sanity and traded TailwindCSS for Emotion.
