Huginn and Muninn bring rumors of a feast to bid farewell to the dying year!
The final musical raid has been executed, and now the time has come to break open the mead barrels and drink this f..king year goodbye!
At the same time, We, the hymn-weavers, welcome 2021 with a drunken grin and high hopes echoing across the realms of Yggdrasil! A new album will dawn, and with that a new chapter will emerge for all the viking powerdeath banners to gather under! More details to be, proud pagan horde..

Until then; eat, drink, mate and praise the heathen gods, and Odin will smile upon you all!

Hail the new year! Hail the hordes that celebrate this threshold! F.ck Covid! Hail the dawning of the new album! Hail the Aesirs inspirational ember! Hail the hymn-weavers horde! Hail Havamal!
Happy f..king new 2021!!!
