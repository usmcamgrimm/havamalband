Brave Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins faith!
We have searched far and wide, across shadows and light for a new axe-wielder to fill the role as one of the hymn-weavers of the Aesir. And We found what We searched for.
Warriors, We are extremely proud to present our newest member and bass-wielder, **Tino Vesanen**!
May the pagan flame burn deeply-rooted in his veins, and may the strength of Asgaard always follow his path!
Hail our new brother and praise Odin's wisdom!
Due to covid restrictions We had to postpone our photo session, but rest assure a new line of Havamal pictures will arrive in a close future!
Hail Tino! Hail our newest member! Hail his thundering bass! Hail our pagan hordes! Hail the old gods! Hail the hymn-weavers!

Hail Havamal!
