Another year is passing by, and the seers at the all-knowing Spotify Wrapped has delivered a raven message through mist, black fires and mountain passes, and the signs read fortune for the year past.
We, the hymn-weavers, would like to thank each and everyone of our Einherjars and Valkyries for this years numbers! You are the bulwark that makes these numbers possible and gives us continued strength to pass Odin's mighty hymns unto you!
We thank you, and hope to see you all in 2021 when this sh.t is finally over! Soon We've beaten our own personal Ragnarök!
Hail our warrior horde! Hail Spotify Wrapped! Hail this years number! F..k Covid19! Hail the new album! Hail Odin's infinite wisdom! Hail Havamal!
