Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, Heed!

Ravens brings whispers of both bad and good news regarding "The Shadow Chapter" vinyls..

Firstly, bad news is that we have to postpone the shipping date again due to bumpy roads and harsh seas from the factory with the test pressings. But this will be the last (crossing fingers) time We change the date.

The new shipping date will be 15th July!

The good news is that We now have received the test pressings and after the listening session We can confirm..

That it sounds as it should: Epic!!

As you can see on the picture, Andreas is quite satisfied with the results.

So bear with us, and your order will be sent from 15th July, by Odin's will!
