Warriors with blood of Aesir strength, We humbly declare in a ravens whisper that our hymn, Berserker, have broken 200.000 streams on Spotify and well beyond 100.000 viewers on its Youtube videos!

The gods smile upon you, brave warriors of Odins will and fury, and We're truly humbled by your response and your continued support! Hopefully soon enough We'll gather for a musical raid together under one pagan banner, but meanwhile, the hymn-weavers wishes to once more thank each and everyone of our Einherjars and Valkyries for keeping the pagan flame alive!

Hail our mighty fans! Hail the gods inspiration for our hymns! Hail the songs that flows from Asgaard! Hail Odins infinite inspiration and wisdom! Hail Havamal!
