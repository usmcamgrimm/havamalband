Our proud Einherjars and Valkyries, heed!

With pride We, the hymn-weavers of Havamal, marched our banners into SolnaSound Recording to begun the journey into our next chapter two days ago!

8 songs have been recorded on the drums this weekend!

Ravens will take to the skies from within our musical fortress with whispers from the gods about our hymns development. Soon a new pagan legacy will emerge from the forges of Svartalfheim to be unleashed upon the nine realms of Yggdrasil! Expect one Hel of an album!

Hail Solna Sound Recordings! Hail this new album! Hail the inspiration from the old gods! Hail this new era! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
