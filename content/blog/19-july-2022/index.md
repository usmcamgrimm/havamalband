Heed Einherjars and Valkyries!

Due to circumstances completely out of our control, the manufacturer of the vinyl edition of The Shadow Chapter have managed to send out a wrong version of the album.

This means that the preorders that have been sent are faulty.

As stated in the message below, this wrong is being corrected, and you loyal souls out there will soon receive the correct version of the vinyl!

The people that are being affected by this should have received an email with more information.

Although the band had no part in this process, we still extend our apologies, and ask for some patience will this is being sorted!

Thank you all for your support from us in the band!
