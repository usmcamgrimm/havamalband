In the world of old
There's a legend told
Ancient terror awakened
Seven times entwined
Fiend of all mankind
By the gods forsaken

Jaws with teeth of dread
Eyes of burning red
Spawn of Loki's temptation
From the black abyss
Hear the serpent's hiss
Jormungandr's damnation

Dragon of the sea
Damned eternally
Scorned by Odin's fear
When my endless hateful might was clear

God of Thunder's bane
Thor will curse my name
Ragnarök is mine
I will drown the wretched ending time

Dwelling down beneath
Summoned from the deep
By my one true enemy
One to stand and fight
Wielding equal might
He who dares to oppose me

Odin's firstborn son
Wanted me undone
Mjölner trembling with power
Eitr guide his fate
Death through rightful hate
Thor I will devour

Lord of every sea
Doom of Midgard's tree
Yggdrasil will drown
By my wrath I'll bring the Aesirs down

Thor and I will fight
In the twilight plight
Thunder meets the waves
Our clash will lead to our graves

Remember my call
Through Hymer's tale we forged our fall
Torn and bound by hate
To seal our final fate
