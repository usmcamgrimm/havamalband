Stormclouds gathers from the North  
To shroud our Eastern land  
Where the sun will never set  
Across the burning sand  

Spawned from evil deeds long ago  
From birth our brands are drawn  
Scorched by flaws from elder gods  
Now fear the rise of dawn  
Hear the sound of coming war  
An endless anguished flood  
A pantheon from forlorn worlds  
Will cloud our skies with blood  

Hear the sound of a thousand feet  
And chants of unknown tongue  
Our mighty walls will breach and fall  
Our culture dies too young  
Feel the wrath of mother North  
Now dread this pagan horde  
All light will fade as death approach  
His call won't be ignored  

Hear our cries  
Gods of old awaken  
Rise up, defend our mythos life  
The north has arrived  
Our worlds order will tremble  
Save us from the flames of morbid strife  
Or empires will burn  

Death of Tiamat  
Her heritage arrives  
By our bloody sins  
Marduk's curse through norsemen thrives
