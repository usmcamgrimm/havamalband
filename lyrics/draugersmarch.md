Long ago in Aesir times our heritage was strong.  
Known through force and sheer, brutal will.  
We fought whomever crossed our path, for Valhalla we die  
And Odin smiled and praised our skill.  

On our knees we did solemnly  
swear our axes and shields to our lords.  
In times of need and in times of war,  
we would stand with the gods facing Yggdrasil's hordes.  

And so the darkness came, the world were drenched in ice.  
The Fimbulwinter's howl froze every vein.  
When we heard the mighty call from Heimdall's gjallarhorn,  
we turned around and fled in mortal shame.  

Broken and lost, we were cursed by our choice,  
and our oath was pummeled into dust.  
We knew if any Aesirs lived throughout the fight,  
they would swear a great vengeance on breakers of trust.  

Fight for what you believe in,  
or the dead will come for your sword.  
You're a coward, a traitor, defector,  
and for this you will join the ranks  
of the Drauger horde.  

After the war Baldur stood alive,  
and he spoke to us through fury and through gloom  
"You did break your oath now your fate is sealed.  
You will be the thing man fear when they flee before their doom."  

Fight for what you believe in,  
or the dead will come for your sword.  
You're a coward, a traitor, defector,  
and for this you will join the ranks  
of the Drauger horde.  

You were chosen to fight and die,  
You were sworn to the Aesir's side.  
You swore an oath to fight,  
and yet you choose betrayal.
