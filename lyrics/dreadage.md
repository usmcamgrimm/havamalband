The skies slowly turns to red, as prophecies fortold.
A darkness sweeps towards the worlds demise.
Challenging life itself these lands will gravely bleed,
from wounds and scars an endless night will rise.
Now, stand proud, and fend off the creatures, that hides in the shade.
Now fight, or die, a proud fate awaits once you enter the glade!

With frozen looks defiled by time, and silence in their minds,
The army of the fallen rise anew.
Summoned from the darkened depths with death as force of mind,
Both froststains and firelinks are spewn!
The ritual, is done, eternal night start, to take its own shape.
All hope, is gone, resist your own fate!

A new age begins, the soil starts to burn.
The frost fires sweeps through our sins.
The ashes of time will scattered from light,
the dread age of man is nigh.
Our memories, whispered from a world, turning blind.

Lost inside a vortex, of never-ending pain.
The age of man shall end, tonight.

Now, stand proud, the dead army marches, and we will hold fast or,
Fall, if we die, Valhalla will greet us to battle once more!

The new age begins, the soil starts to burn.
The frost fires sweeps through our mind.
The ashes of time now scatters from light, the dread age of man is nigh,
our memories whispered, from a world turning blind.
