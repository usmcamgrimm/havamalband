Beyond the ocean's cold mighty roars,  
beneath the murky void.  
In storm-ridden waters, she lies in wait,  
to drag, to drown and destroy.  

Ran, scourge of seas,  
one that makes you drown.  
Shorten life-breath inside her net,  
dragging you endlessly down.  

Once you're caught there is no escape,  
the waters will soon be your grave.  
Down to the depths of her halls you'll be dragged,  
in death you will become her slave.  

Lured by Ran into the darkened sea.  
Down to halls of drowned eternally.  

Claims your death and life beyond all time.  
Ran do lure and guide your final climb.
