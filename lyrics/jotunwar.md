Drenched away from sunlight's eye,  
where shadows dance at dawn.  
Where frozen peaks of endless pain  
drowns in eternal storms.  
That's where I ask, my warriors,  
with battle scars from old,  
To stand with me, once more arise, let  
your destiny unfold!  

Rise as one, a force feared and known.  
Jotunheim will now face the northern hordes.  

Our warriors descend on soil,  
where frozen hope awaits.  
The eerie sound of nothingness,  
is hastily flung away.  
Brace yourselves, my warriors,  
and raise your battle cries!  
The giants will draw back in force  
Once we teach them how, to die!  

The ground starts to tremble, the skies becomes black.  
With hate and despair the giants attack.  

Fight till death is what we want,  
our freedom we will claim.  
My soul is linked through forge and flame,  
to face whatever pain.  

Blood to bone!  
Forever gone.  
An eagles flight.  
Forever stained!  

A close-call victory was won that frost-stained day.  
The giants were driven back in vengeance bloody name.  

Stand proud, my Einherjars,  
we've won this dreaded day,  
the giants forces in the north,  
will soon be swept away.  
Now clean your wounds and swipe your blades,  
more thresholds lies ahead.  
And I won't stop my darkened path  
until they all are dead!  

The rimsurturs will pay this day, eternal night will fall.  
The war of Aesirs's claims our souls, and victory's our call!  
Bretheren will fall to them, but we will persevere.  
They will drown in their own blood,  
And our names they learn to fear!
