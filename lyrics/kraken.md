All alone in the darkest of night  
On a frozen, blackened sea  
There a ship drifts alone  
Where gods won't hear their plea  

From the bow comes a hopeful shout  
"My captain, I see land"  
We turn our heads to realize  
That something's not as planned  

Fear the unknown of this realm  
The dead will tell ye all of its tales  
Oh underneath the waves  
An ancient monster awaits  

From the depths a vicious roar  
Caused all of our courage to seep  
Tentacles of unknown height  
Begins to slither down from the deep  

"Draw your axes, draw your swords  
And pray to Odin our lord!"  
The crew will fight against all odds  
Or it will drag us overboard  

Fear the unknown of this realm  
The dead will tell ye all of its tales  
Underneath the waves  
An ancient monster awakes  

From a time that even the Aesirs fear  
Deep below where Hel is near  
A watery death awaits whomever comes there  
Kraken dreaded by mortal mind  
King of squids your ship will find  
And drag you down into its domain  

Screams now dies out one by one  
As the monster chooses its prey  
The crew diminishes rapidly  
Escape looks rather grey  

Suddenly the sea grows calm  
And the ship is lost to sight  
We are doomed down the abyss  
Brought down by Kraken's might  

Fear the unknown of this realm  
Now we dead will tell ye its tales  
Underneath the waves  
The drowned lost crews awaits  

From a time that even the Aesirs fear  
Deep below where Hel is near  
A watery death awaits whomever comes there  
Kraken dreaded by mortal mind  
King of squids your ship will find  
And drag you down into its domain  

When the seas are finally calm and still  
When you've sealed your fate against your will  
Remember our eternal sleep  
Heed my warning, heed my call  
The king of squids will spell your fall  
So turn back or join us in the deep
