Far from the god's light  
Trapped down in shame  
A freezing howling  
Will spell my name  

A sin unraveled  
A bloody trail  
An act of vengeance  
Will be my tale  

From Angrboda's  
And Loki's sin  
I came to Asgaard  
First of my kin  

They raised a servant  
Their friend in mind  
But time would show them  
A darker kind  

I bring night to where the sun will be  
I bring storms to those that do defy me  
I bring fangs to man when I strike and  
I bring death to friend and foe alike  

I curse your name  
Entwined in chains  
And I'll be the one  
That brings flames  

Twice chains were lost  
Gleipnir's my cost  
Tyr's wrath is mine  
For all of time  
Bound down in shame  
I curse your name  
Odin, face your crime  

Hate and blood of foe, that is my call  
Grow my strength and fury once and for all  
When I break free from dwarven steel  
I will end the world's eternal wheel  

Sing my forlorn song across the battlefield  
Now know my name, I'll be the Aesir's bane  

Fenrirs will rise, although bound thrice  
And I shall bring god's demise  
Odin will fall, once and for all  
And Vidar will end my final fall
