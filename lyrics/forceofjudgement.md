Ever since the universe was born,
I've observed it, from the shadows.
I gave it knowledge, fears and life,
I am alfa, I am omega.

An endless darkness stands as my own home,
I have lived there, long past the eons.
Bound to be the judge of every soul,
a harsh god, an entity of justice.

Now, all my time, and all my life,
has been lost, amongst the stars,
but my mind, still recall, a time beyond words where,

lies, that agonize, still will haunt,
my raging vengeance. Where all,
cries, they will drown, a thousand times,
in the blood of their masters.

Search your own self, judge your own glood,
Remember your call and unleash you doom
Realease your own hate and cry for your soul,
the judgement day for the universe has come.

They will all remember my name,
when the nightsky descends upon them.
Nothing in the universe is safe,
when I show my own true fiendish form.

So, day and night, became one,
when the shadows consumed them
all, and the skies, starts to bleed,
from the almighty flames.

Now prepare, your demise, you will quench,
my raging vengeance. Where all,
cries, they will drown, a thousand times,
in the blood of their masters.
