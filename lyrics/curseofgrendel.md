Our story dwells in pagan times
When darkness ruled in Denmark 500 AD
Hrothgar mighty king of Danes
Sat on his throne, proclaiming loud and joyously
"Warriors, enjoy your mead in this great hall
This Heorot, I've built for you"
The walls were shaking from the songs of drunken tales
A grand feast our Hrothgar threw

Suddenly all lights went out and silence rose
As the warriors drew their swords
Through the gates I smashed my way into their hall
For death and hate I roared
Crushing bones and drinking blood of fallen foes
Thirsty souls were lost in pain
The morning after Hrothgar said
"Now seal this hall, no joy will echo again"

The curse of Grendel's fate
A path of vengeful hate
In blood and hope they'll pay
For casting me astray

Finally I met my match in geaten hands
When Beowulf and I did meet
Iron gripped, two equal beasts, in mortal dance
For victory we did compete
Beowulf then topple me and snatched my arm
I ran, defeat was mine
Ultimately loss of blood demanded my rest this one final time

A legend has been born
From where my life was torn
But know this from my tale
The one true monster did prevail
