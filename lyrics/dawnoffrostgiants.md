Can you feel it in the air? The smell of death tonight.
The ice gnawing deep in our bones.
On the tundra frozen wide all hope is cast aside
and suddenly we long for our homes.

Lost in our despair, we failed to feel the shift,
the mountains sprung open in the North.
And the soil itself did sunder
from the cold that struck us all,
and the lords of ice and frost sprung forth.

In the piercing snow, in the midst of cold,
we can hear their frost-filled cries.
Our blood will catch the sun's first rays.
See, the dawn of the frost giants rise.

The battle now commenced,
and the giants circled in,
their ancient hate from Ymir's death we felt.
Our steel now faced these mountains,
their cold condemned us all,
and our Norn-woven fate was dealt

When the night is gone our feast will come,
Valhalla calls for me.
For Odin I've died tonight,
by the frostsspawns killing spree.

In the piercing snow, in the midst of cold
our steel will bow to ice.
Our blood will catch the sun's first rays
See, the dawn of the frost giants rise.
