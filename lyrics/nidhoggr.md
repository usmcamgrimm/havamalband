Deep below through a sea of mist
In the realm where dead man dwell
Lies a monster, a dragonlord
Next to the Hvergelmer well

Chaos-tainted, a spawn of the dark
Creator of foul-ridden deed
Gnawing on roots that uphold the Tree
Our world will wither and bleed

In the land of the ice and the cold
He feasts upon the dead
Rips the flesh and drinks the blood
He chains our fear like lead

Bringer of our destruction
His shadow forever grows
Ender of our bright bold age
Our time he overthrows

Enemy of Hräsvelg
On top of Yggdrasil
Caught by hate and madness
Through times eternal and forboding seal

His primordial decree
Proclaims that he will be
Ruler of all evil
And bane of our World-tree

Nidhöggr, world-eater, scourge of the tree
The night before the dawn
Long will he live after Ragnarök
The beast from worlds all evil once did spawn

Through flames of war we'll see
The fall of Yggdrasil
For which he patiently
Will gnaw eternity
