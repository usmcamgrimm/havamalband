Long before time of times,
before our kind stood tall.
In the midst of emptiness,
fire, ice and nothing ruled all

Right between Nifelheims coldened grip
and the fires from Muspelheim.
Two spawned from one will unite once more
and form our realms of Nine

Ymir now stood from the merging smoke,
and Audhumbla came alive.
They were the source, through their unity
a new world would soon arrive.

Realms will awake.
Witness the birth of time.
Ancient orders soon to break
A new age will reach its prime.

Call on the force of Ginnungagap.
When fire and ice will collide.
Mau and beast will be spawned from these,
their own fate they shape and decide

Ymir did fathered the jotun race,
and the scourge of the giants began.
Spawned from the salt that was sealed in ice,
the dawn era created man.

Through Bures legacy, Bor and Bestla gave birth.
Through the sons of trinity,
the first of the Gods did unearth.

See, the beginning of our Yggdrasil.
Witness the birth of time.
Frost and fire gave us what is real.
And the gods would arise to proclaim their new-born prime

Minds of Odin, Vile and Ve,
shaped what we see as all.
Song of Bor made everything,
through the mighty Ymir's fall

See, the beginning of our Yggdrasil.
Witness the birth of all.
Ask and Embla shaped the human wheel.
And the gods would arise to uphold our one true call.

It was the beginning of times,
when nothing us did blind.
Neither grass nor earth, was to find.
No heavens above, just a gap that unfold,
The emptiness our world did hold.
