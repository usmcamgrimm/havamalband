Dawn of shade awakes, a new threat arrives.
A creature hid from human eyes,
full of death and hatred.

Vile and foul in heart, vengeance in his mind.
A monster chained from human eyes,
one of Hel created.

Chant for your protection,
look beyond your fears.
A nightmare has escaped its realm,
to terrorize mankind.

Many will be slaughtered,
few will tell the tale.
The Gods themselves have made it clear,
we're not allowed to fail.

A blood-stained day arrives, our banners dance with pride
a heathen horde stands proud and still awaiting battle.
Now, close your lines, raise your arms
and prepare for slaughter.

Suddenly the silence dies, the air grows thick of fear,
the nightmareborn emerges upon the chosen field.
The monster strikes a roar with its hatred to the skies.
The shaman priest now chant the runes,
the fearsome creature now must die.

Born from flesh with Aesir strength,
the enemy will fall by my blade.
Man and beast must fight once more,
for our Aesir faith our foes name will fade.

Darkness faces steel, blood-crazed hate will kneel,
the battlefield will weep with the blood of thousands.
Beast and man will stand, one will rule this land,
the fate of all of Midgaard will forge itself today.

Born to fight, live to die,
the Aesirs gaze with pride when they die.
Man has conquered beast once more,
victorious we chant our battle cry.

Blood.
