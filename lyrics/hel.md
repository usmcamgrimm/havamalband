Judgement comes for all of us  
Frozen chains from dark beyond  
Pathways that we choose in life  
Will forge our chains and bond  

Every soul is weighed by death  
And destiny's cruel game  
Either you will bask in blood  
Or sleep in endless shame  

Some of us will die in fight  
When Valkyries give call  
These Einherjars, blessed by war  
Will stand in Odin's hall  

Some of us will die in vain  
By age or by disease  
Outcasts from the glorious dead  
Shunned by god's displease  

Those that die without a fight  
Will walk on frozen plains  
Where endless hunger, frost-rid cries  
And grim-clad sorrow reigns  

You will board the Naglfar  
A ship from dead men's nails  
All you souls, abandon hope  
To Nifelheim we sail  

In this land of death and cold  
Hel do rule supreme  
Last of trickster Loki's blood  
Now a darkened queen  

One side pale and beautystruck  
That's only matched by Frey  
Other half is maggot-filled  
Dead and ashen grey  

Banished by gods  
Betrayed by their highborn lord  
Ensnared in her hate  
Declared deaths own shadow ward  

Cast away from Aesir's halls  
Broken, tattered, scorned by dread  
Vengeance cured in twilight times  
When she commands the vengeful dead  

Helheim grants a cold embrace  
If your demise lacked battle cry  
Kneel before your one true god  
And pledge allegiance when you die  

The goddess of spite  
End times will grant her right  
To claim stolen life  
Through Hel gods will know demise
