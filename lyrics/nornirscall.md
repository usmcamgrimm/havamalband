In the depths of Yggdrasil  
Near the roots there lies a well  
Do fear the rite  
On this ancient site  
Where death itself will dwell  

Hear the whispers in the wind  
Their beckoning, their call  
When your life will end  
For your soul they'll send  
To the underworld you'll fall  

The weavers of your fate  
Both future and your past  
The rulers of all prophecies  
They deem which breath is last  

So no matter what you do  
To evade their mortal rule  
You will jump their ledge  
By a scissor's edge  
They will play you like a mindless fool  

The first of three is Urd  
The eldest of her kind  
She will spin your thread  
And you'll know you're dead  
By her cut your doom is signed  

Verdandi rules the now  
The presence is her task  
She will judge by sight  
Every wrong or right  

And Skuld the future holds   
When she calls you will descend  
She will weave your fate  
Your destiny create  
The seer of all things' end  

The Nornir rules us all  
Both man and god will kneel  
Their wen of life becomes our strife  
And our final voyage they will deal  

The stories we will face  
And when we end our days  
They weave your rise to fall  
Hear Nornir's call  

We all are born to die  
By Nornirs when and why  
Towards the unknown tide  
We'll walk with pride  

The masters of your soul  
Our journey they make whole  
They will undo us all  
When they do call
