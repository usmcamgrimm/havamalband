The twilight of the Aesir faith is nigh,
the Fimbulwinter's cold, strikes hard!
For three long years, an ever-frost will reign.
The sun is dead and the world is drenched in pain,
chaos time, awake!

When brother turns on brother,
when Heimdall sounds his horn,
then Yggdrasil will bleed,
when the Vigrid plains becomes a battlefield.

The charred-red and Fjalar unleash the darkened, hordes,
while Gullinkambe cals on Aesirs, for war!
The hordes of Hel and Muspelheim arrives,
while aesirs ride from Asgaards mighty halls,
all sworn to die!

The Fenris wolf will swallow the sun,
while Hatr devours the moon.
Jormundr will wash ashore and drench the the world in doom.
Loki pierce his former friends with words of rage and hate,
Surt engulfes the entire world, in a final, fiery fate.

Mjolnir crushes the giant snake of dread,
but his poisoned blood will snare Thor, to the dead!
Odin falls as Fenris devours him whole,
but Vidar avenge his king with the dreadwolfs soul!
The world is lost!

Tyr will slay the fearsome Garm,
from the belly, of the beast.
Loki and Heimdall is locked in fight and neither will see the feast.
Darkened forces faces the gods in a final, bloody fight.
The world will burn from Ragnar√∂k, the end time strikes tonight!
