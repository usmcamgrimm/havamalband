Warriors standing still.  
Awaiting the battlefield.  
Crows soon will feed.  
Upon our deadly deed.  

Cold in blood, darkness floods,  
as soldiers shorten their breath.  
Conquer fear, Odin's near,  
to hail your brutal death.  

Thunder, starts to roar.  
Thor, looks for war.  
Remember, when you fall,  
your're welcomed to Odin's hall.  

Call all souls across our realms.  
Odin's horde. Stand as one and chant the Havamal.  

Call all souls across our worlds.  
Prove your worth and abide to Odin's words.  

Warriors find your fate in your fall.  
Valhalla's horde. Now fight and die for the Havamal.
