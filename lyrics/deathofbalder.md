This dire tale I bring to you  
A story without hope  
An event that sealed the Aesir reigns demise  
The story I must tell to you  
The tale of Balder's fate  
Will echo through the memories of time  

Dreams told of death  
That Hel was prepared  
To accept Balder when he dies  
Frigg made everything  
Swear on its pride  
That all sort of harm  
Her son could defy  

Balder was immortal  
And the gods amused themselves  
By striking him so brutally and raw  
But Loki had other plans  
His heart was growing dark  
And the end of Balder in his mind he saw  

Out of a mistletoe and arrow he did forge  
And placed it in Hödrs Hand  
The blinded bond of blood  
The arrow did shoot  
And Balder's life was banned from Aesirland  

Balder your fate is sealed  
Death from a blind man's shot  
The end times will bleed for you  
And the world as we know it will be forgot  
Einherjars fulfill your oath  
The Norns holds your fate  
There stand the world-tree dimmed and charred  
Now fight for it, unleash Odin's hate  

Ride for seven days and night  
Cry out for my son  
Hel will promise redemption if your sorrow will be shown  
Töck refused to bow or mourn "He stays below" she said  
And therefore Balder once again was cursed back to the dead  

Höder must pay, Loki must pay  
For their crimes against our own kind  
Höder was slain by his own son in rage  
While ravens they traced down the source of the sin  

Balder your fate is sealed  
Death from a blind man's shot  
Loki caught in a cave  
His treachery would seal his fate  
Cold winds chilled whispers bring  
A conflict to end them all  
Vengeance through Loki's deed  
Will be our final fall  

Now that Balder's gone our worlds will burn
Through Ragnarök our world... must... fall
Oh, oh cruel world
