Our story will lead to a gloom-filled descent,
a path stained with madness and pain.
Trust with your instincts, don't look with your eyes,
or find your own soul lost in vain.
The sharp edge of hate glows within my own mind,
when the froststorms are leaving their mark.
With a vengeance denied and a hate growing blind,
a blood-curse is born from the dark!

The walls starts to crumble inside my mind cell,
my sanity is finally erased.
From the ashes of hope, a mad god arise,
blood-drunk, all twisted and crazed!
My etheral precense is stopped by no walls,
no mortal shall deny my call!
With a vengeance denied and a growing downfall,
a blood-curse is born from the dark!

Cold winds are roaring, all through the night,
My presence shakes the Earth!
Guardians of time and death, feel my broken trust!
when I find my former fiends I'll turn them into dust!

Scream out in fear of the pain that will come,
your knowledge is fuel for my hate.
So come all, come out, wherever you hide,
and face your own grim-cloaked fate!!
I am awakened to undo my death,
from your own fate you cannot flee.
My judge from beyond shall enslave your whole lives,
your souls will set me free.

Revenge upon you, freedom denied.
Death will makes your call!
Fight your own sadness, loose all your hope.
I will awaken judgement call!
