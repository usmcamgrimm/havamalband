Born for war and reaping of lives
Our warrior stands alone
Death surrounds his every step
As his fate is carved in stone
Frozen lands unveils his fate
To fight until he dies
Now son of bear with cloak of strength
Unleash your furious cry

Blood and war forever sworn

Known through ranks of enemies
More beast than man in mind
Hundreds have been forced to die
Their heads his axe will find
Inside lives a raging beast
An animals lust for more
The bear inside outgrows the man
And throws him into war

For my gods I do declare
Blood through loathe will be my oath

Berserk, murderer, servant
Of the gods
Slayer, killer, murderer
Sound the horns
Berserk, murderer, champion
Of the gods
Slayer, killer
A warrior beast demanding blood

Forced to live a war-torn life
A bear disguised as man
His strength and hate will know no end
He's like battering ram
The the frozen north he bends his knee
His will is with the gods
With the axe in hand and a bear in mind
A berserker shows his form

With the gods I will conquer them all
Blood and war forever sworn

Berserk, murderer, servant
Of the norns
Slayer, killer, murderer
Sound the horns
Berserk, murderer, champion
Of the gods
Slayer, killer
A warrior beast demanding blood

Berserk, murderer, servant
Make them fall
Slayer, killer, murderer
Call for war
Berserk, murderer, champion
Raise your swords
Slayer, killer
A warrior standing tall
