Lille, our musical raid continued with a tremendous effort of you, our brave hordes!

Together We made Lille shake to its core. A thousand bloodied thanks to our warriors last night!

A bloodied part of that thanks goes to [@labratcave](https://www.instagram.com/labratcave) and Kevin to house us last night, and to [@arntor.a.windir.tribute](https://www.instagram.com/arntor.a.windir.tribute) for a great show!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Lille! For La Brat Cave! For [@hell.frog.promotion](https://www.instagram.com/hell.frog.promotion) ! For our pagan horde! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
