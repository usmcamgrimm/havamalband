Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

We would, the second week of the video, like to extend another huge thanks to the artistic efforts of the much talented [Olga Kann](https://www.facebook.com/olga.kann.art) at [Olga Kann Art / Design](https://www.facebook.com/olgakannartist)! For providing our singles with such a rich visual interpretation of the mightiest of Aesirs!

Give her a shoutout and a like, and may our paths cross again for the future!

Give listen and praise to The Storm King, for soon, another hymn will pierce the darkened horizons..

For Olga! For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For the new hymns! For the listeners and viewers! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
