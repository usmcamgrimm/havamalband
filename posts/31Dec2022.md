Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

A year's cycle is soon to an end, and a new years path will be traversed. With this dying year behind us We wish to thank our warriors that attended our European tour, our live shows and those that kept the heathen flame alive with our hymns of Olden Gods, a thousand bloodied thanks to all of you!

We give thanks to the year that have passed and give new horizons to the year to come!

See you out there in 2023!

For Tyr! For Odin! For Thor! For all our warriors! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
