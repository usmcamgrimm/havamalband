Einherjars and Valkyries Heed!

In fourteen days from today, we once more steer our longships to the land called Frankia.

Last time we were in the heart of Paris, this time we're invading Noisiel at Cernunnos Pagan Fest!

As you can see on the Running order, we're closing L'abrevoir stage at 20:00 on Sunday and lending the torch over to Skálmöld.

Hope to see you there!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Cernunnos Pagan Fest! For our pagan horde! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
