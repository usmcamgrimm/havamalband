Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The ravens now proclaim in awed whispers to the One-Eyed that a musical raid over Europe is looming..

This april, Havamal's hymn-weavers will set our drakkars across the lands in the Hel over Europe tour!

Prepare to partake in our musical rites and chant the words to the olden gods together with us!

Join us, warriors, to immortalize 2024!

Links to each event will be presented soon, stay updated and vigilant!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our pagan hordes! For the tour to be! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
