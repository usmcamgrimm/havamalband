Tomorrow our pagan heroes will head south to conquer central Europe, but more to show the power of their mighty Melodeath.

Many will be pleased to feast with them for the first time.

I wish I could attend more venues than just Bree and Geleen, but unfortunately Coastrock was cancelled. 

Hope to see some guys from the Horde around.

Let's wish them a safe and glorious trip!

Hail The Shadow Chaptour!

Hail HellFrog Promotion to make it happen!

Hail HAVAMAL ü§ò

The best of luck for your tour guys! ‚ù§Ô∏è
