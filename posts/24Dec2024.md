Einherjars and valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Now the time for merry-making and Yule-celebration is upon us!
And tho silence have been ruling the golden hall for awhile,
what happens in the deep musical mines will not stay silent for long.

The new album is sounding gigantic already and We cannot wait to share our work with you, proud horde!

But until then. Feast, drink and make all-Father Odin, aka the real Santa, proud of your joyous efforts!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For the Yuletide! For our celebrating warriors
across the Nine Realms! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
