Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Ravens brings whispers that the hymn-weavers drakkars will once more set their course to germanic soil to bring the wrath and brimstone of our musical raids to our heathen hordes!

We will bring Odins hymns to Mittsommernächte Bärenstein 2024 on the 21-23 of June 2024

We hope to see as many of our gathered pagan hordes on spot so that your voices will reach the golden hall itself! So buy your tickets before they're sold out, by Hel!
