ow We hail the departure the passed years cycle for the welcoming of the year of Havamal, in 2026!

As Skadi sits proudly upon her frozen throne, embracing the world, We too embrace the year to come!

The musical blót plans are being laid out, and grand plans for the future of the Havamal camp is brewing deep in the mead-cauldrons of Valhalla. 

Welcome the coming year together with your hymn-weavers, brave horde!
