Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Ravens whispers that exactly one years cycle ago, our drakkars turned towards the heart of Europe with our Shadow ChapTour.

And now, one year later, the time closes in for another musical raid! So, Germany, are you readyto gather your hordes, face the hymn-weavers and partake in our musical raid together with our battle-brothers in [Zornheym](https://www.facebook.com/zornheym)!?

Join us at either [Bambi galore](https://www.facebook.com/bambigaloremusikclub) on the 29/9, [Coastrock Festival](https://www.facebook.com/CoastrockFestival) on the 30/9, or both!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our german hordes! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
