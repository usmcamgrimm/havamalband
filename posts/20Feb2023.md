Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

A thousand bloodied merci beaucoups to the mighty Cernunnos Pagan Fest for having us raiding your shores and for delivering this massive support!

We are truly humbled and can't wait too meet our frankish warriors once more in the future!

Now our drakkars return home to count our plunder and to plan future raids...

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our pagan warriors! For Cernunnos! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
