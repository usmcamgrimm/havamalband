Hello friends of the harder stuff! The Keller Geträller Vol. 3 was a week ago now. Many thanks to everyone who made this evening so fantastic. Especially the bands Havamal, Rotting Empire, Drowning In Blood & Dead Knowledge with their mega-strong performances.

To the E3 Eiskeller for providing the venue. To Tom Silence for the fantastic sound. To Tobi for the lighting and to our KRUUU who was constantly on duty.
Whether behind, on, or backstage. THANK YOU SO MUCH for your commitment to the club ❤️❤️❤️

Photos of the event can be found at 81ZombiePictures or Explizite Zungen.

And we're already in the final stages of preparation for our Pure Fucking Metal Festevil on July 11/12.

See you there!
