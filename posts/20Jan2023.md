Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The ravens now proclaims that it is less than a month until the hymn-weavers drakkars invade France at [Cernunnos Pagan Fest XIII](https://www.facebook.com/events/756411288742161/) on the 19th of February!

Which of our warriors will attend and musically raid together with us?

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our pagan horde! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
