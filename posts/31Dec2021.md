Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

As another year nears its own deathbed to pave way to a new circle, the ravens and ourselves reflect the year that was;

\- We found the last puzzle to become a complete band again, Tino!

\- A new hymn collection known as "The Shadow Chapter" unfolded to the Nine realms.

\- We joined forces with Hell Frog Promotion

\- We played our first offshore gig and festival as well as our first festival.

\- We got to partake in interviews, podcasts, clips, tv, photo sessions and a mjolnirton of rehearsal and studio time, and We had one Hel of a time throughout it all.

But most importantly, We kindled pagan fires across the worlds where all our fans, old and new, felt the spirit of Odin growing within with our hymns. Your dedication and passion for our songs of olden times is really the driving force behind Havamal, and for your support We cannot thank you enough!

Here's to the next years cycle! May Odin bless us with live shows and endless mead in our drinking horns, oh dwellers of Midgaard!

Time to drink, feast and forget our troubles for this glorious night! Now, let the mead flow like wine!

Hail the new year to come! Hail our hordes! Hail all that have involved themselves with us! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!

Gott Nytt År!
