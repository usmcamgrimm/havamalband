Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom,  heed!

A thousand bloodied thanks to Palatset and Hell Yeah Rock Club for this awesome night in the Honor of all-Father Odin! We couldn't have asked for a better horde to musically raid with (apart from Luigi ofc)!

A huge shoutout to Grimner and Hell Frog Promotion for making this night as epic as it became! Once more, all warriors tonight, a thousand bloodied thanks from the All-father himself!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our pagan warriors! For Palatset! For Grimner! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
