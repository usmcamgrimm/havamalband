Odins ravens brings news from a metal pod for our swedish listeners!

Rulers and valkyries under the eternal wisdom of Oden, hear us!

Our own axe swinger Kjell sat down with Morten in [The Swedish Metalpod](https://www.facebook.com/swedishmetalpod) and answered questions about everything under the sky of the Nine worlds!

Big thanks for letting us participate! And we are now all, with freshly sharpened weapons ready, curious about what the next band offered to the pod thinks of Stockholm, and if they answer correctly....

For Tyr! For Thor! For Oden! For Morten! For our listeners! For the anthem weavers! For Havamal!
