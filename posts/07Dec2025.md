Linköping, you gave us an unforgettable debut night for Age of the Gods!! We have missed our musical array with you, and look forward to the next drawing together!

A thousand bloody thanks to the organizers, Headsic, Bloodmarked and Hell Yeah Rock Club! And another thousand bloody thanks to Brigitte and our fantastic horde!

And a special shoutout to our German hordes of Havamal that attended last nights musical raid! 

For Tyr! For Tor! For Oden! For Hell Yeah Rock Club! For our pagan army! For Age of the Gods! For the anthem weavers! For Havamal!
