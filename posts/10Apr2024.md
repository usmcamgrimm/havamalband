The second raid of Paris since Ragnar was a huge success thanks to you, mighty horde!

What a warm and epic night indeed.

France has once more proven their metal spirit, and We couldn't be happier to musically raid you last night! A thousand bloodied thanks to our warriors!

And a huge thanks to our battle bretheren in NzgL and Orkhys , you guys really riled up the place!

Next our drakkars heads toward Lille and [La Brat Cave](https://www.instagram.com/labratcave/). See you there, brave horde!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Le Klub ! For Hell Frog Promotion ! For the hordes that attended last nights show! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
