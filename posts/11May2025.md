Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Last nights musical raid was a tremendous experience for both us, the hymn-weavers as well as Odin himself!

We want to extend a thousand bloodied thanks to our warriors that partook in our musical blot, to the amazing Pure Fucking Metal Festevil and Hell Frog Promotion for arranging this, and the amazing venue crew at Keller Getr√§ller for making this night worthy of the old gods!

Pucture cred goes out to Brigitte at Hellfrog.

Tonight, Spirale in Berlin will feel the wrath of the norse gods! Prepare, faithful horde!
