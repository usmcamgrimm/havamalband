Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The hymn-weavers of Havamal wish to extend a huge bloody thanks to the masterminds behind our latest visual monster, Fredrik and Frank at Askebris!

Their expertise knew no bounds, and they could adapt to anything We wished for. Truly masters of their craft!

Give them a shoutout and a like, and prey to the old gods that our paths will cross soon again in epic collaboration!

If you missed it or needed it once again, here's our common craft, The Storm King!

For Thor! For Tyr! For Odin! For Askebris! For Fredrik! For Frank! For all of our hordes! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
