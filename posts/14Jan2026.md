Our musical raid in our hometown made Odin smile and raise a meadhorn high in our names!

We want to thank O'Learys in Vällingby for the awesome venue. We want to thank Blodmärkt, Thy Kingdom Will Burn, Headsic, Slow Fall and Ondfødt for joining us during this event. We want to thank Brigitte at Hell Frog Promotion for arranging this amazing festival. And We want to thank our fearsome horde that attended the night's blot. A thousand bloodied thanks to all of you!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Hell Frog Festival! For the warriors that attended! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
