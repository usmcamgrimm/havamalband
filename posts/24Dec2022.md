Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

All-father Odin once more disguises himself to bring the Yule spirit across all the Nine Realms, and with him the hymn-weavers of Havamal wish our pagan hordes across Yggdrasil a merry Yuletide and an ever-filled mead horn!

For Tyr! For Odin! For Thor! For all our warriors! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
