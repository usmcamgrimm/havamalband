Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Reviews for our new opus Age of the Gods are still presented in front of Odins throne, and so We would like to extend a bloodied thanks to Teeth of the Divine for their excellent take on our musical blot!

Give it a read and listen to the hymn-weavers gift to Midgaard to compare your experiences!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Teeth of the Divine! For our listeners! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
