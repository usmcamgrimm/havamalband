"HAVAMAL  at Cernunnos Pagan Fest XIII 2023" by [Musika.be](https://www.musika.be/2023/02/24/cernunnos-pagan-festival-19-februari-2023-dag-2/?fbclid=IwAR2UwjacT98_lVF1V6cG2F37LesL9HZ3apbx_aXjXcabKEPHBz1HOGJ9-Hc)

>"Havamal was the last band in l'Abreuvoir. Havamal brings melodic death metal. Lyrically it is often about Norse mythology and that is why they belong at this festival. That Havamal are no one-hit wonders is proven by the two albums that were released via the Spanish Art Gates Records and that still reach a high level. That high level is simply continued live. Jawadde say, what a dazzling set. The five of them simply flattened the room. Remember the name. We will see Havamal on much bigger stages."

We were overwhelmed by your support, by Hell Frog Promotion enthusiastic work and by Cernunnos Pagan Fest XIII joyful experience and overall professionalism! Hope that our drakkars will descend upon frankish soil once more in the future!

Next raiding stop, FINLAND!!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Cernunnos! For musika.be! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
