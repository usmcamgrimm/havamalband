Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Our drakkars once more heads towards our home shores with bittersweet emotions. Sweet due to the epic raid last night at [Hell Yeah Rock Club](https://www.facebook.com/HellYeahRockClub), [Palatset](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063454008315), Linköping. But also bitter since this was Andreas last musical blot with us. We wish him eternal glory and raise a drink to our now fallen hymn-weaver, skål!

To the crew, organizers, the crowd, [Hell Frog Promotion](https://www.instagram.com/hell.frog.promotion), [Zornheym](https://www.facebook.com/zornheym) and [Ondfodt](https://www.instagram.com/ondfodt_official), Odin's blessings upon you all!

Now homewards to prepare for the coming big news. Asgaard's musical forges are trembling and something will soon be unleashed upon the Nine Realms...

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Raise Your Horns! For Palatset! For Andreas! For our pagan hordes! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
