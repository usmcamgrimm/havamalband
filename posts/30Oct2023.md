Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Raise your shieldarms and mead horns for our mighty axeswinger Lennie in this day of his birth!

This elder youngster deserves every praise, so let not a single glass be completely empty before sunbreak tomorrow!

For Lennie! For the year that passed and the years to come! For the celebrating hordes! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
