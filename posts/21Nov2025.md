More aggressive and commanding than ever, the album showcases the variety and musical finesse the hymn-weavers have long aimed to unleash. Sweeping symphonic🎶 power collides with scorching riffs, all driven by drums that strike with the fury of the Thunder God⚡and vocals that channel the wrath of the Nine Worlds. It is a work shaped to feel both majestic👑 and unforgiving, a culmination of years of evolution, finally brought to its peak.
