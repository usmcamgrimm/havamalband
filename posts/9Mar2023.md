Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Ravens brings two grand reviews from our fearsome musical raid at the mighty Cernunnos Pagan Fest , and in frankish nontheless!

We miss you France, and hope to raid your shores soon again!

**Valkyries Webzine**:

>"Havamal officiates in a melodic death, enriched with epic orchestrations and focused on Norse mythology. We immediately think of Wintersun, but also of Brymir and Kalmah. On stage, the musicians are very comfortable, super energetic, the singer BjÃ¶rn interacts regularly with the public and presents the different pieces of his guttural voice seeming to emerge straight from the abyss. The man even came among us to sing in the pit".

**Vecteur Magazine**:
