Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

What an absolute treat for the pagan gods this gig was! You guys immortalized our journey! A thousand bloodied thanks to all our German warriors for last nights show!

We would like to give a huge shoutout to Stiriah, Muggefug e.V. and Hell Frog Promotion for this musical feast!
