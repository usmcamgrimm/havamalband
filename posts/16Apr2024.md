As our drakkars now have made it homewards and the battle cries lies as a close memory, We look back over our musical raid over Europe with tired yet fond memories.

Together We've traversed Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium with intense speed and determination. We've spread the heathen flame across thousand of kilometres to pagan warriors across our realms.

We wish to extend a huge thanks to the venues and promoters:
