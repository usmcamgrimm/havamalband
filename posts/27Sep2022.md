Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Yesterday vikings once more laid siege to Paris! Not since 845 has there been such a successful raid in this glorious city!

The hymn-weavers of Havamal would like to give a huge shoutout to Le Klub, our brothers in arms in Kozoria, to our beloved Hell Frog Promotion and lastly a huge bloodied thanks to you Paris! What an epic night!

Next stop, [La Brat Cave](https://www.facebook.com/LaBratCave), Lille. See you there.

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For the warriors of Paris! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
