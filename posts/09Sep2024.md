This past weekend I played my last two shows with HAVAMAL  at Raise Your Horns 2024 DK and Palatset Link√∂ping Swe (Hell Yeah Rock Club) together with Ondf√∏dt  and Zornheym.

A perfect end of an era!

I want to say thank's for the past seven years to my brothers from another..Dudes..

It's been one hell of a ride and a big thank you to Brigitte at Hell Frog Promotion!

It has been a pure pleasure sharing hotel snoaring nights, visiting Vineyards on day off, hangry situations, eating snails, becoming sick together during tours. I can go on forever..

And of course playing all the shows together and just being together and have a great time! 

I will always remember my time as fun time together with the guys in Havamal. No matter what time we had to go up to drive to the next city or country.

From the very bottom of my heart, thank you Kjell, Tino, Bj√∂rn, Lennie and Brigitte!

"Soldiers of love".

I wish you only the best for the future to come.

And to Luigi, Putte, Bj√∂rn,Kenta and everyone else who has been involved within the Havamal camp in one way or another.

I also want to say thank you for coming to the shows and for showing support!

The time has come for new musical adventures and I'm passing my torch over to another guy that you'll hear more from quite soon.

Take care and you'll hear more from me soon. This is only a new beginning üòâ 

Sk√•l!
