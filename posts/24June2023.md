Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The ravens bring whispers that We've surpassed 100.000 streams on each of our most popular songs! All thanks to our glorious pagan horde!

Tell us, warriors, what is your favorite hymn or hymns, and where would you like us to play these hymns live during a musical raid?

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our listeners! For Spotify! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
