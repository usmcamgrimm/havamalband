Another years cycle is drawing to an end, and with that, Spotify Wrapped shows the true power of our hordes listening hours once more!

Havamal thrives and breathes for its musical warriors, and We are overjoyed to see the thousands upon thousands of Odin's faithful that have listened to us across the Nine Realms this year!

Odin praise your dedication with mead and bloodshed! And We hope to see as many of you as possible on the roads and raids in 2026!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our listeners! For Spotify Wrapped! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
