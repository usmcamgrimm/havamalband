Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Ravens brings whispers from a night of barbequeing and mead-heaving with the hymn-weavers and Hell Frog Promotion gathered, which today pounds our head comparable to a giant having a taste of Mjolnir!

A bloodied thanks goes out to Erika WG for the bountiful gifts of alcohol you provided during our Shadow Chaptour! Our taste buds loves you and our livers hates you!

Finally, the silence from our side is not for nought..

For the musical forges works overtime, and new music is being prepared as you read these words!

All Nine Realms, prepare yourselves for what to come...

For Tyr! For Odin! For Thor! For good company! For Hellfrog! For our hordes reading this! For Erika WG! For new music! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
