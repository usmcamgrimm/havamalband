Oden's warriors from all realms, hear the ravens of Oden whisper these words!

On April 29, 2023, Havamal will share the stage with the mighty Grimner in Link√∂ping, Palace!

It will be an epic evening in the sign of the heat flame that will shake the foundations of the Valhall itself!

Don't miss out on honoring Oden together with the anthem weavers, but buy your ticket here before they run out!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Oden! For Grimner! For our army of heathens! For the anthem weavers! For Havamal!
