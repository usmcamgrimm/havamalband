Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The role of drumserker as well as a musical battle-brother to the hymn-weavers is no easy and lightly filled task. Yet Hugin and Munin have searched the Nine Realms and brought the answer We were looking for. Please give a bloodied and mead-stained welcome to our new hymn-weaver Stefan Peltonen!

In his own words, Stefan proclaims:

My name is Stefan, and I have been chosen to play the drums with my brothers in Havamal! I thank everyone in the band for trusting me with this big responsibility!

I embark on this journey with great anticipation and exitement, We have so much in store for you guys! More on that later!

I cant wait to share the stage with the guys in the band and to see all of you, our great fans on tour! 

Lastly of course, For Havamal!

We know that through his technical and musical boundless abilites and spirit, Havamal will throw itself into a new golden age! More of these news will soon be heard from the halls of Asgaard..

In the meantime, give our new defender of the hymns a welcome befit the gods, and celebrate his name throughout the night and day!

For Stefan! For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For the future! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
