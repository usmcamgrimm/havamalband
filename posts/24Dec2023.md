Once more the time has come for merry-making, mead-heaving and reckless joy of gifted plunder upon each other! The Yuletide is upon us once more and We, the hymn-weavers of Havamal, as well as the true frostfather of Yule, Odin, wishes all of our warriors across the Nine realms a happy bl√≥t and a feast worthy of the olden gods!

Merry Yuletide! 2024 will be the year of Havamal! Be prepared..

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For the Yuletide! For All-father Santa! For gifts! For mead! For family! For the warriors! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
