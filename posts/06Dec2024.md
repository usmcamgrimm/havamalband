Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The ravens whispers of the past year in awe and thanks to the hordes that have stood by our side during times of change. Old hymn-weavers lost, new hymn-weavers chosen, a silence that hides an ancient thunder almost ready to be released upon this world, the year 2025 will be one for the songs by the firesides..

Once more, a thousand bloodied thanks to our faithful warriors for these numbers! We'll make sure those ranks swell even greater for the next years cycle!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For the hordes that have listened! For Spotify Wrapped! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
