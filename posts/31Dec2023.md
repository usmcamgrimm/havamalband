Another year has passed. We've musically raided the realms, met unforgettable warriors and created memories undying as well as We hope We've created memories to live beyond Ragnarok itself to our warriors!

We are now ready to raid the musical world with what to come! Stay vigilant, brave horde! 2024 will be the year of the hymn-weavers, do prepared your musical defences..

Thsnks to all new that came, all that have been and all to come! Odin smile upon your 2024, and We hope to raid your shores then!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our hordes across the Nine realms! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
