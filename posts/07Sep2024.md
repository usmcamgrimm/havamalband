Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Ravens brings whispers of the succesful musical raid last night, when the hordes at [Raise Your Horns](https://www.facebook.com/raiseyourhornsdk) showed their devotion to the old gods, and that danish steel is as strong as ever!

A huge thanks to the venue, the crew, the audience and the bands with a special shoutout to [Ondfødt](https://www.facebook.com/Ondfodt) and [Zornheym](https://www.facebook.com/zornheym).
