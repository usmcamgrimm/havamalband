Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Now as our drakkars head toward our homeland once more, We look back to Germany with joy and pride!

A thousand bloodied thanks to all the venues, arrangers and most importantly, our hordes for attending this musical raid across germanic soil!

An extra big shoutout goes out to Brigitte and Hellfrog Hell Frog Promotion for arranging this raid in the first place. Also to Luigi for making an extra trip just to see us. Forever a huskarl!

Rest assure that We will be back to partake in a musical blot with our pagan warriors soon again. We will then bring the wrath of the brand new album that arrives later this year!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Germany For our warriors that attended! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
