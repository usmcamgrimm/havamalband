Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Another years cycle is close to be sealed, and as We eagerly awaits SÃ³ls return to the frozen North, We wish to thank our faithful heathen warriors for the continous support and spreading of our hymns!

Without our hordes We would be nothing, and We want to thank each and everyone of you for listening, spreading, watching, partaking and embracing the All-fathers musical words to you all through his hymn-weavers!

For 2024 and the grand musical raids that awaits!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For all of you that support us! For 2023! For 2024! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
