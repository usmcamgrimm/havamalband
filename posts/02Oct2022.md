Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Germany, We couldn't have ended the tour in a better way. You guys startled Odin himself with your war-cries last night!

A thousand bloodied thanks goes out to Heiko and The Scotsman Pub, and Hell Frog Promotion for organizing this epic night! And another thousand thanks to all of you warriors that attended this raid. You guys truly upheld the pagan flame!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our pagan warriors! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
