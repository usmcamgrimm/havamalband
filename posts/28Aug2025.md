Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Our drakkars will once more descend upon German soil, to partake in a musical blot this summer at Metal Power Open Air!

We call upon all of our german heathens to join our musical raid, and welcome Allfather Odin into their hearts and souls as the songs of old will fill the nights void!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Metal Power Open Air! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
