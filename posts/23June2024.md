Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Our raids upon germanic soil are over for this time and our drakkars once more head homeward. But it is with joy and pride in our pagan hearts, for Germany will always have a special place amongst the metal heathens of Havamal!

We wanna give a huge thanks to the promoters, crowd and the overall festival of [Mittsommernächte Bärenstein 2024](https://www.facebook.com/events/2519568584882563/) for partaking in our musical blot last night! A thousand bloodied thanks to you all!

Also a special tour-thanks to our huskarls Luigi and Chris for continually upholding the heathen flame with us!

Now, We return to the North to prepare for the upcoming raids.

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Germany! For the hordes that attended! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
