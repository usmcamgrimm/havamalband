France, Odin smiled upon our musical raid last night! And it's all thanks to you, mighty horde!

[Ar'Vran Festival](https://www.instagram.com/arvranprod), you guys solidified the metal spirit of Old, and the We, the hymn-weavers, couldn't have been happier. A thousand bloodied thanks to our pagan warriors! Can't wait to raid your festival again!

Our drakkars now turn towards Paris and [Le Klub](https://www.instagram.com/le_klub) on the 9th of april. Join us in our musical blot!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Ar'Vran! For the hordes that attended last nights raid! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
