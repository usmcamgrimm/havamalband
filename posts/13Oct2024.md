Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Silence has ruled for a while in the hymn-weavers stronghold, but know that this silence does not apply to idle actions. In fact, the forges have worked in the shadows tirelessly. And with that, We can proudly say that the next album is full written and ready to enter the studio with!

In the coming passage of time, the hymn-weavers will present the progress and emerge with what We feel is the strongest album to date. We cannot wait to unleash this beast upon Nine Realms!

So bear patience, brave hordes! Grand things are closing in.

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For the new album! For our waiting warriors! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
