Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Once again, our warriors dedication to the heathen flame is worthy of admiration and a few minutes of awe. That our hymns would be interpeted by a fellow pagan soul is truly worth a thousand smiles from the All-father himself!

Enjoy this cover of Jotun War by Guillaume Kiefer! Give praise to his musical effort and get lost in this swirling, ancient battle once again in a new style.

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Guillaume! For Jotun War! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
