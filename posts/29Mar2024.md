NEW HYMN RELEASED!!

Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The ravens proudly proclaim that our new hymn, Song of Nine, is released upon our realms!

Give it a listen, and another one, and another one.. and before your ears bleed out, share it with your Yggdrasilian metal family, and let us know what you think about it!

This beast together with The Storm King will sunder across Europe very soon. Will you stand with us and produly chant the lyrics in unison by blood and banner!?

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Song of Nine! For our listeners! For the upcoming tour! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
