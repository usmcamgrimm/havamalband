Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The ravens brings a thousand bloodied thanks to Bambi galore and the hordes in Germany for joining us in a musical blut worthy of the gods last night! We also like to extend another bloodied thanks to the crew and staff that made the night possible!

And of course another thousand bloodied thanks to the mighty Zornheym for inviting us to the insane asylum.

Next stop, Coastrock Festival today! Join us, by Hel!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Bambi Galore! For our german warriors! For Zornheym! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
