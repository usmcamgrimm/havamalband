Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

The ravens whispers of a coming musical blot in Germany next year! We, the hymn-weavers, invite our hordes to gather at the mighty Keller Geträller vol 3, on the 10th of May 2025!
This will be the hymn-weavers first raid in Dorfen, so be sure to partake in our historical heathen ritual, by Hel!
