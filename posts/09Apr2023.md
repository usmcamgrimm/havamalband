What a night to kick off our finnish debut!

A thousand bloodied thanks to Varjobaari, Thy Kingdom Will Burn and all of you warriors that attended our musical raid in Odins honor last night!

Tonight, Bar Loose will feel the wrath of the swedish norsemen echoe in their shattered minds for eternity! Prepare yourselves!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Varjobaari! For our pagan horde! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
