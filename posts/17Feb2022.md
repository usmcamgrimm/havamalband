Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Now ravens bring news across the Nine realms, that the land of mist slowly dissipates and present this golden opportunity to once more emerge from the live shadows.

Havamal to play live at [Klubb Fredagsmangel](https://www.facebook.com/fredagsmangel/) on the 15th of April 2022!

How We have longed to bring our musical raid upon the worlds! For two years We've waited to bring our drakkars to Stockholm once more!

We hope to see as many of our fearsome warriors with us this evening!

Hail the live shows! Hail Fredagsmangel! Hail those that will join us! Hail Odin's infinite inspiration! Hail the hymn-weavers! Hail Havamal!
