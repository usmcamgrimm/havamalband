Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

On the 22nd of June, the drakkars from the Havamal dock will embark on German soil to partake in a musical blut dedicated to the hymns of the Olden gods! Bärenstein, We're raiding your Mittsommernächte festival this year!

Will you heed the call and summoning, warriors of Germany!?

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our German hordes! For Mittsommernächte! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
