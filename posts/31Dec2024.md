Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Now Maní completes her one last cycle around our Nine Realms to bid farewell to the year 2024. A tumultuous year indeed but a year to remember nontheless. We sang our farewells to a hymn-weaver while embracing another. And also, the next album is sounding better by the day!

We hope 2025 will mark the milestone of this new Havamalian era, and We bid all of our warriors to join us in these times of glorious future endeavours.

So raise your horns for 2024! Raise your horns for 2025! And raise your horns for the hordes of Havamal!!

Skål in Odins name!
