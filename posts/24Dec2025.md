Once more the Yuletide brings tidings of blót, mead-heaving and plundered gifts to celebrate the musical raids that was and the musical raids to be!

Join Odin's path as the One-Eyed god travels disguised as the All-Father of the Yule across all Nine realms, and make merry in the Olden ways!

From the hymn-weavers to our celebrating hordes, a merry Yuletide and Odin's blessings upon you all!
