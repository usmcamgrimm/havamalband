Einherjars and Valkyries of Odins wisdom, heed!

Ravens now proclaims that our tour has ended, and our drakkars have finally returned home with riches, gold and an overhwelming sensation of joy and lust from our journeys!

This tour has been a milestone for the band and the hymn-weavers as well, and by that it has steeled our resolve to embark on musical raids across the world in the future!

Big plans will be in action in the time to come.
