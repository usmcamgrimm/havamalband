You guys showed us what Belgian metal was made of!

A thousand bloodied thanks to [Asgaard Gentbrugge](https://www.instagram.com/jh_asgaard) and Gent for partaking in Odins hymns!

Next raid, [Ar'Vran Festival](https://www.instagram.com/arvranprod) in France. Prepare to see our drakkars on the horizon tonight!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For Gent! For Asgaard Gentbrugge! For the people that attended last nights show! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
