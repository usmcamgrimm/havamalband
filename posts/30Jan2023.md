A thousand bloody thanks from the hymn weavers to [PoW WoW Rock Fest](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086991661271) Mats and Magnus for letting us have a musical feast with you all!

Very spontaneous but it made it all the more fun that the audience was with us throughout our musical journey in the signs of Nordic mythology!

Big thanks from Havamal to the organizers and everyone who praised the gods with us!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Oden! For our warriors out there! For the anthem weavers! For Havamal!
