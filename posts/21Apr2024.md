After thousands of intense miles through Europe with my blood brothers and the heart of our band, Brigitte, I can say that it has been a roller coaster without its equal.

I live for moments when you see a sea of horns fly to the rhythm of your symphonic command, and in the crank afterwards only want to collapse of exhaustion and dehydration. But it's all worth it, and my 200% is 300% less than what I want to give for the tour and the live experience!

Always bitter sweet to come home after being crowded, jailed, laughed and lived with such fantastic people as you are; Kjell, Lennie, Andreas, Tino and Bree ❤ but life needs to return to normal. Now it's full-length planning and upcoming festivals. Plans for the next tour are already in the works, so no tears along this Viking cheek!

Now it will be cured and composed a little. Oden's blessing to you who managed to read all the way.

Just saying thank you to all the support acts, bands, venues, crews and all the amazing fans throughout this tour!

And for the inside joke, a gigantic WOW!! for this time! The next tour will be if possible even better!
