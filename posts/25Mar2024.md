Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

In less then a week, our new hymn will pillage your soul and memories!

And more so, our drakkars will head out across Europe to fulfill our desire for musical raids!

Who's ready for some old and new hymns throughout the realm!?

Prepare, proud hordes..

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For the new single! For the tour! For the hordes that will listen and attend! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
