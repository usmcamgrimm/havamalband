Einherjars and Valkyries of Odin's wisdom, heed!

Ravens brings you a mighty hymn from the halls of our Aesir lords, from times when We raided the eastern shores in November last year!

Empire of the Ashen Sun live at Harry B James, Stockholm.

For all our warriors whom did not join in flesh, but in spirit, enjoy this beast of a hymn and get lost in the tunes of old!

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For HBJ! For our pagan horde! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
