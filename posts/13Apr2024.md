As our drakkars head towards our final location at [TYRFEST 2](https://www.facebook.com/events/880062373840646/), We, the hymn-weavers, wish to extend a thousand bloodied thanks to the warriors the penultimate nights musical raid!

[Le Grillen](https://www.instagram.com/legrillen), Colmar, you immortalized yourselves in our memories. Odin smiles upon you!

A huge thanks to [Trigger](https://www.facebook.com/Triggerbandfr), [Beyond The Void](https://www.facebook.com/beyondthevoidmetal), [Hell Frog Promotion](https://www.instagram.com/hell.frog.promotion), [Aching](https://www.facebook.com/aching68) and to all the crew and the venue, you showed us how a real performance should be prepared! 

For Tyr! For Thor! For Odin! For our warriors that partook in last nights musical blot! For the hymn-weavers! For Havamal!
